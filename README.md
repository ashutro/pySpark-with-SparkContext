# pySpark-with-SparkContext
"Immerse in RDDs, parallel processing, and cluster resource management. Unleash scalable data manipulation with PySpark &amp; SparkContext. Learn through diverse Spark use cases.

"1.Lenght.ipynb->
This code uses PySpark to analyze a text file. It calculates and prints the length of each line, then sums these lengths to find the total characters in the file. Finally, it stops the SparkContext.

"2.Accumulators.ipynb->
    The program uses an accumulator to count the even numbers in an RDD. It showcases how accumulators enable parallel aggregation of data across worker nodes and safely return the result to the driver program.
